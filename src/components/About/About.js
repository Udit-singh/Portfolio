      <SectionText>
      I am currently a third-year Computer Science undergraduate student at Chitkara University. I would be interested in training programs, internships or certifications focused on Flutter, Dart and MERN Stack, and App Development.

I am always ready to have new experiences, meet new people and learn new things. I Ô¨Ånd the idea of creating value and developing some amazing things for the community and impacting the world through my gratifying work.

I do have a quite expertise in deploying, managing and scaling virtual machine instances, ec2 servers and many more using Google Cloud Platform-(GCP) and Amazon Web Services-(AWS).
